# Web Development Project 3 - *Soccer Flashcards pt2*

Submitted by: **David Raet**

This web app: **This is a soccer flashcard website to test your knowledge on soccer**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features
The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The user can enter their guess into an input box *before* seeing the flipside of the card**
  - Application features a clearly labeled input box with a submit button where users can type in a guess
  - Clicking on the submit button with an **incorrect** answer shows visual feedback that it is wrong 
  -  Clicking on the submit button with a **correct** answer shows visual feedback that it is correct
- [X] **The user can navigate through an ordered list of cardss**
  - A forward/next button displayed on the card navigates to the next card in a set sequence when clicked
  - A previous/back button displayed on the card returns to the previous card in the set sequence when clicked
  - Both the next and back buttons should have some visual indication that the user is at the beginning or end of the list (for example, graying out and no longer being available to click), not allowing for wrap-around navigation

## Optional Features
The following **optional** features are implemented:
- [X] Users can use a shuffle button to randomize the order of the cards
  - Cards should remain in the same sequence (**NOT** randomized) unless the shuffle button is clicked 
  - Cards should change to a random sequence once the shuffle button is clicked
- [X] A user’s answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
  - Answers are considered correct even if they only partially match the answer on the card 
  - Examples: ignoring uppercase/lowercase discrepancies, ignoring punctuation discrepancies, matching only for a particular part of the answer rather than the whole answer

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented required features:

## Notes

- More technical project since I had to understand the nuances of user input and 
defensive programming to "never trust the user"
