Project MVP Plan: Combat Sports Forum
Day 1: Set Up & Core CRUD Functionality
Goal: Users can create, edit, view, and delete posts.

Setup

Scaffold your app (React, Next.js, or your stack of choice).

Set up basic routing (Home, Create Post, View Post).

Choose a simple backend or mock data store (Firebase, Supabase, or local state).

Set up authentication (optional, skip for MVP).

Core Components

Post Creation Form

Input: Title (required), Content (optional), Image URL (optional).

Post List (Home Feed)

Display posts with: title, creation time, upvote count.

Clicking a post opens its details.

Post Detail Page

Shows full post (title, content, image).

Edit, delete, and upvote buttons.

Comment section.

Day 2: Adding Interactivity
Goal: Sort/search posts and interact (upvote, comment).

Sorting/Searching

Add sort dropdown (by date or upvotes).

Add simple search bar (filter by title).

Upvoting

Each post has an upvote button (increments count; one per click, no auth needed for MVP).

Comments

Add a text-box for leaving comments below the post.

Display a list of comments under each post.

Day 3: Gamification & Polish
Goal: Add a lightweight gamified touch and responsive layout.

Poll or “Fun Bet” (optional for bonus points)

Add a hard-coded poll to the home page: “Who wins this weekend’s fight?”

Allow users to vote and display poll results.

Badges or Points (optional bonus)

Give users a “Top Commenter” badge if they leave 5+ comments.

Display a simple leaderboard based on upvotes (can just show top 3 post authors).

Styling & Design

Use a simple, clean theme.

Make sure it works on both desktop and mobile.

Add MMA-specific flair (color, images, icons).

Day 4: Final Touches & Testing
Goal: Ensure MVP requirements and clear UX

Finish any missed features or bugs.

Test all user flows: create, read, edit, delete, upvote, comment, view feed.

Write a short README explaining features, setup, and any limitations.

Deploy to a simple hosting (Vercel, Netlify, Firebase hosting) if possible.

(Optional) Record a 1-min walk-through demo video.
